		<h1>Rock Band</h1>
		<p>Some work I did on the "Rock Band" series of games</p>

<p>While in junior college, I worked at a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Studios">Pi Studios</a> as a video game Quality Assurance tester.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty awesome job where I gained some experience with bug tracking systems and drank way too many energy drinks for $15 an hour.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Though I didn't keep great track of what I worked on and I'm not listed in the credits for every game I actually did work on, I can confirm my name appears in the credits for the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack for Playstation 3</li>
<li>Rock Band Track Pack Vol. 2 for Playstation 3</li>
</ul>
<p>I worked on versions of the game for 3 consoles: Xbox 360, Wii, and Playstation 3 (though I may not appear in the credits for all of them)</p>
