<h1>About The Game</h1>
<p>Drone Control was my senior project at University of Houston Clear Lake in 2015. I worked as part of <strong>Team Flight</strong> which included 4 other students.

<p>Back then, drones were a new and exciting technology which wasnt quite affordable to the average person. We convinced our school to purchase a Drone, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_AR.Drone">Parrot AR.Drone 2.0</a>, and we worked on a two part project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a simulation style game that mimicked the operation of a drone. This would be used to train pilots without worrying about crashing an expensive drone.</li>
<li>Using the same user interface and input device, have another portion of the game where the actual drone could be piloted and its video streamed into the application.</li>
</ol>
