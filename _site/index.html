		<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience in development and design.</p>
<p> Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with languages such as C#, Ruby on Rails, C++, Golang, and Rust. My expertise also includes client build pipelines, with significant experience in Azure Pipelines. </p>
<p>Throughout the majority of my career at HP Inc., I specialized in Windows Client software, refining my expertise in C# and C++, while also expanding my knowledge of various other programming languages and tools.</p>
<p> In addition to my technical expertise, I have had the privilege of mentoring interns and sharing my knowledge. This site serves as a collection of projects I've worked on, as well as a showcase of my achievements.</p>
