# About The Game
Super Starkiller 3000 is a project I decided to challenge myself with by developing a complete game in under 2 months.

The game is a mouse-follower shoot-em-up style arcade game with some story elements sprinkled between levels.

Super Starkiller 3000 was featured on both [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/news/2018/07/super-starkiller-3000) and [Html5games.net](https://www.html5games.net/super-starkiller-3000/)<br><br>

Play the game [here](https://fahseltc.github.io/SUPER-STARKILLER-3000/)
