# About The Game
Super Starkiller 3000 is a project I decided to challenge myself with by developing a complete game in under 2 months.

The game is a mouse-follower shoot-em-up style arcade game with some story elements sprinkled between levels.

You can play it here: [SUPER-STARKILLER-3000](https://fahseltc.github.io/SUPER-STARKILLER-3000/)


The game was featured on [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/news/2018/07/super-starkiller-3000) and [Html5games.net](https://www.html5games.net/super-starkiller-3000/)

## Project Goals
- Finish developing a game in under 2 months
- Collaborate with friends
- Make a web browser game with Javascript
