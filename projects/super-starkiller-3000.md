# About The Game
Super Starkiller 3000 is a project I decided to challenge myself with by developing a complete game in under 3 months.
You can play it here: https://fahseltc.github.io/SUPER-STARKILLER-3000/
The game was featured on Phaser.io https://phaser.io/news/2018/07/super-starkiller-3000
and HTML5games.net https://www.html5games.net/super-starkiller-3000/

## Project Goals
- Finish developing a game in under 3 months
- Collaborate with friends
- Make a web browser game in Javascript using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
- The game is somewhat fun and playable
