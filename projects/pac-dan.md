# About The Game

Pac-Dan was one of my first personal game development projects that I worked on while I was in college - mostly to get more experience writing and working with projects larger than a few files.

It was created in Java using the open source game library [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/)

View the [source code]({{ repo }})

You can play the game by downloading and running the raw `PacDan.FINAL.jar` file from the repo. (though this is a sketchy means of distribution) [Latest Release](https://github.com/fahseltc/Pac-Dan/releases/tag/1.1)

# The Pac-Man Dossier

This game was developed based off of the [Pac-Man Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info/) which is an extremely detailed document about Pac-Man and how it works by Jamey Pittman. If you have any interest in Pac-Man and how it works, I would highly recommend you give the document a look.
