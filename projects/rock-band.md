While in junior college, I worked at a company called [Pi Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Studios) as a video game Quality Assurance tester.

Overall, it was a pretty awesome job where I gained some experience with bug tracking systems and drank way too many energy drinks for $15 an hour.

## Credits

Though I didn't keep great track of what I worked on and I'm not listed in the credits for every game I actually did work on, I can confirm my name appears in the credits for the following games:

- AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack for Playstation 3
- Rock Band Track Pack Vol. 2 for Playstation 3

I worked on versions of the game for 3 consoles: Xbox 360, Wii, and Playstation 3 (though I may not appear in the credits for all of them)
