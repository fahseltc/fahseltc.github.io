# About Arkham Horror LCG
[Arkham Horror LCG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205637/arkham-horror-the-card-game) is a card game by Fantasy Flight Games. Its a deckbuilder / story-driven horror adventure game based primarily on the works of HP Lovecraft.
The game uses an "Living Card Game" (LCG) model, where a specific box contains a known set of cards. This removes any 'gambling' or luck from purchasing the cards and results in a better overall model.
